For example, if we calculate the frequency of each unique value in `name`, we don't learn much, since names generally do not repeat. "

The string processing function that will be most useful to us is `.str.split()`, which allows us to split each string in a `Series` by some sequence of characters.  (In other words, the `split()` function is _broadcast_ over the strings in the `Series`.) Since the surname and other names are separated by `\", \"`, we will split by `\", \"` to obtain two chunks, the first of which is the surname."
